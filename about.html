    <div>Name: Naoki Miyagawa<br>
        age: underage<br><br>
    I made this website because my old one was terribly optimised and also pretty cringe with all the amongus references<br>
so I thought it was time to make a new website; an easy to use website; a minimal website;<br>
10 minutes of work, and here is the result: Naokisite V2, now with Naoki's new V2 engine, which is better than chromes V8 engine.</div>
